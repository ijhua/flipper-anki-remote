# Anki Remote for FlipperZero

This simple app is based on the ![FlipperZero firmware](https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-firmware). It is a bluetooth remote with shortcuts for Anki: revealing card (spacebar), again (1), hard(2), good (3), easy (4), and undo (z^*).

Currently only tested with the desktop Anki app. Does not work with AnkiDroid for some reason. 

To compile after making changes, use ![ufbt](https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-ufbt). 


Disclaimer: this is my first time working with C and I am not a professional. 

^* for undo to work with z, you will need to customize the shortcut on the anki app.
